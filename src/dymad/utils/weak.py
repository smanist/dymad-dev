    r"""
    Generate weights for a weak formulation approach, returning arrays (C, D) and
    the number of "windows" K along the time dimension.

    Steps:
        1. Compute a length scale:

        .. math::
            L = \frac{t_{N-1} - t_0}{2}

        2. Generate Jacobi polynomial basis (P0) and its derivative (P1), each
           with alpha=1, beta=1, on a grid of size n_integration_points in [-1,1].
        3. Construct weighting arrays for the integrals:

        .. math::
            w_0 = 1 - h^2,\quad w_1 = -\frac{2h}{L}

        4. Compute Newton-Cotes integration weights on that grid.
        5. Combine everything to form:

        .. math::
            C = -(P_1 w_0 + P_0 w_1) w,\quad D = P_0 w_0 w

    Args:
        dt (float): Time step size.

        poly_order (int): Order of the Jacobi polynomial basis.
        int_rule_order (int): Order of Newton-Cotes integration rule (1..4).
